## Daily Special Maker

The Daily Special Special Maker is a small internal application for use in generating reasonable daily specials!

## Planned features.
- [ ] Menu entry. Allowing users to add in their own menu items and ingredients. Each Menu item has many ingredients.
- [ ] Ingredient shelf life. For a given type of ingredient, there is a shelf life. We could have a rudimentary inventory system. So that the user just checks.
- [ ] Price entry. Users should be able to update their prices. This could be an input from an excel sheet, or maybe even a data feed, if such a feed exists.
- [ ] Seasonal suggestions. For a given set of ingredients, we should have some seasonal suggestions if the ingredients are available. Stone Fruits in American Fall, and Certain vegetables during the month. This keeps the rotation fresh.

- [ ] Adding in Seasons. Seasons are set for the user when they expect food prices for a given item are low.

## Installation

Daily Specials is built ontop of Laravel 5.1. I would recommend setting up an environment, like Homestead, first. then cloning this project into the ~/Code folder.
